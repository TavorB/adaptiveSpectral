# Adaptive Learning of Rank-One Models for Efficient Pairwise Sequence Alignment

Code accompanying the paper "Adaptive Learning of Rank-One Models for Efficient Pairwise Sequence Alignment", NeurIPS 2020.

Additional code for generating a test dataset and computing minHashes can be found in the repository for our previous alignment work on Spectral Jaccard Similarity: https://github.com/TavorB/spectral_jaccard_similarity.
